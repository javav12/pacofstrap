# pacostrap
## pacstrap for offline installation(manuel arch installation)

Hey guys!
This project is not done yet. So this README wont be long. 
My goal is using a USB(except archiso USB) to install packages on it than install them from USB. 
This project is not writing pacstrap from scratch for offline installation, it uses pacstrap with a few options and customised settings.

Like i said, this project have not done yet (it just formats USB) but i will develop it fully within few days. 

Hey, archlinux devs! If you saw my repo, i would be verry happy if you put this software to archiso.
