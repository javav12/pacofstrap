# pacostrap
## pacstrap for offline installation(manuel arch installation)

Hey guys!
This project is not done yet. So this README wont be long. 
My goal is using a USB(except archiso USB) to install packages on it(1 st stage) than install them from USB(2nd stage). 
This project is not writing pacstrap from scratch for offline installation, it uses pacstrap with a few option.

Like i said, this project have not done yet (only first stage is completed) but i will develop it fully within few days. 

Hey, archlinux devs! If you saw my repo, i would be verry happy if you put this software to archiso. (when this project fully develops)
